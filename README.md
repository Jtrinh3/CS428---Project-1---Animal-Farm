# CS428---Project-1---Animal-Farm
Project 1 for CS 428
## Summary
The goal of our project is to create a demo of what a book may look like with the technology of AR sometime down the future. For this project, we chose the book *Animal Farm* by George Orwell.

## TO DO:

**75% of the points on the project (C level functionality) are for:**

- [x] create an image target based on the front cover of your book so that you can set your book on the table, point your webcam at it, and see the augmented information hovering over the front cover
    - [x] the front cover needs to have the title and author(s) displayed in augmented text
    - [x] the front cover should show a 3 dimensional scene from the book with appropriate lighting with at least 2 lights.
- [ ] ~~need to fix scaling~~ (not too important)
    
- [ ] For each person in your team you need to add the following things to the front scene which should be clearly visible / audible in appropriate scale and appropriate style  
- [ ] _**James**_  
    - [x] at least 5 unique pre-existing models
    - [ ] at least one reasonably interesting unique model you created yourself *(I'll make an arch entrance for the fence)*
    - [x] at least one ambient sound *(pig oinking)*
    - [ ] at least one animated/moving object or particle effect  
- [ ] _**Omar**_
    - [ ] at least 5 unique pre-existing models *(currently at 7 models not including the crown)*
    - [ ] at least one reasonably interesting unique model you created yourself *(perhaps replace the crown with your own K-rool style one?)*
    - [ ] at least one ambient sound
    - [ ] at least one animated/moving object or particle effect
- [ ] the front cover needs to have an AR button that the user can activate which will trigger a 3D character from the book to appear as a spokesperson, in addition to the scene, to speak the name and author of the book and encourage you to read it. The spoken sentence should be audible over any ambient sounds or music you have on the page. A member of your team should supply these sentences and not use anything prerecorded, though you can feel free to enhance your audio recording. *(I can do this)*

**25% of the points on the project are for:**

- [ ] create an image target based on the back cover of your book so that you can set your book on the table, point your webcam at it, and see the augmented information hovering over the back cover by default text should appear above the book giving the title, author(s), language, number of pages, and publication year
    - [ ] the user should see an augmented reality button allowing them to **change** the visible information floating above the back cover from the title / author / etc information to a set of mostly textual reviews, and a set of video reviews (using unity's video player)
    - [ ] for each person in your team you need to add the following things which should be clearly visible / audible in an appropriate scale and appropriate style
    - [ ] at least 2 brief reviews of the book similar to what you would see on rotten tomatoes or amazon with some kind of iconic score (fresh / rotten, thumbs up / thumbs down, n out of m stars using 3d objects), a 1-sentence textual review, brief info about the reviewer, and the date of the review.
    - [ ] one short 10-30 second video review of the book (feel free to be as excited or deadpan as you want in the video review as long as the video and audio are good quality. You can do the review yourself or recruit others, but you need to name anyone else you recruit. You can not just grab something off the web - you need to purposely record the review for this project)
