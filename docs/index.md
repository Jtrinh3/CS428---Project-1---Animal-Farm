# Summary
<body>This project is created to test Vuphoria on Unity 2019.2. The idea of the project is that in the future, augmented reality would be use to advertise books at a glance, somewhat similarly to how bill board works, but now in a more engaging way. This project specifically uses the book <i>Animal Farm</i> as an example. When the book is layed flat and the application's camera detects the book, a 3D scene from the book will appear directly over it, along with informations and a button to listen to the spoke person of the book. On the back side, will be a UI with data that the user may go through to see indepth details, video reviews, and text reviews.</body>
